Security controls are mechanism put in place to mitigate risk, prevent it or reduce the likelihood of its occurrence. 
We can use different security controls to achieve the same purpose.

## Categorising security controls 
### Purpose categories
- *Preventive control* : designed to stop a security issue from occurring in the first place.
- *Detective control* : identify potential security breaches that require further investigation.
- *Recovery control* : remediate security issues that have already occurred.
### Mechanism of action categories
- *Technical controls* : technological ways to carry out security objectives.
> [!note] Exam Tip
> If you see someone use the term logical controls, thatâ€™s the same thing as technical controls. Logical and technical are two different words that describe the same type of control.
- *Administrative controls* : Processes that are put in place to manage technology in a secure manner.
- *Physical controls* : that have impact in the physical world.

# Exam Essentials

- Security controls can be classified by their purpose and by their mechanism of action.
- The purpose categories are preventive, detective, and recovery. Preventive controls are designed to stop a security issue from occurring in the first place. Detective controls identify potential security breaches that require further investigation. Recovery controls remediate security issues that have already occurred. If ransomware infects a system and wipes out critical information, restoring that information from backup is an example of a recovery control.
- The mechanism of action categories are technical, administrative, and physical. Technical controls use technology to achieve security objectives. Administrative controls are the processes that you put in place to manage technology in a secure manner. Physical controls are those that impact the physical world.
