## Privacy
### Role of a Security Pro concerning Privacy
- Protect employees' personal information.
- Educate them on how to preserve their privacy.
- Assist privacy officials on how to protect the privacy of everyone in the company.
### Types of private information
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII) : All information that can be tied down to a specific person.
- Protected Health Information (PHI) : Health care records that are protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
### Expectation of Privacy
This is based on The Reasonable expectation of privacy.

When you post on social media, for example, *you have no expectation of privacy*.
When in the other hand send an email (even if unencrypted even tho you run the risk of eavesdropping) *you have a reasonable expectation of privacy.*
But if you provide information to the government (while filing taxes for example), *you have a much greater expectation of privacy*.
While at work and using the employers equipment and network, *You shouldn't expect privacy*.

Your job is to educate employees on their privacy expectations, mainly that they shouldn't expect privacy while using the company's equipment. 
You should also ensure the proper handling of the privacy of employees and customers and protect company assets and sensitive data (eg; Intellectual property and passwords).

Organisations must maintain their users privacy while they hold their data. And should discard that data as soon as its intended purpose has been fulfilled

*“The entity limits the use of PI to the purposes identified in the formal agreements/notices, and for which a data subject has provided explicit (or implicit) consent.
