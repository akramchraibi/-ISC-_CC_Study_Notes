## Physical Facilities
### Data Centers
It's a house for your data.
Data center access must be strictly limited to prevent the potential theft of resources and information.
### Server rooms
small rooms where servers lives especially if an organizations doesn't need a data center and they tend to lack physical security.
### Media Storage Facility
If you have good DR protocols you should have outside places where your data lives and is backed up. These should also have a great bit of attention when it comes to security.
### Evidence Storage room
Where you store forensic evidence and stuff related to investigations. These should have strict access controls.
### Wiring Closet
Eavesdropping concern -> Protect.
### cable distribution runs
Where cables pass through.

## Designing for security
Physical security expert adopt a strategy called ***crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED)*** : 
1. *Natural surveillance*: This means that facilities are designed in such a way that allows employees and passersby to observe what is happening around the facility and notice a potential intruder. You can achieve natural surveillance by placing windows appropriately, creating open areas around fences, and using adequate lighting.
2. *Natural access control*: This uses gates and other structures to funnel people into a single point of entry and limits the ability of an intruder to get to areas where they might not be under surveillance.
3. *Natural territorial reinforcement*: This strategy makes it obvious that an area is closed to the public through signage, landscaping, lighting, and similar techniques.

## Visitor Management
When allowing visitors into secured facilities, it's essential to have visitor control procedures in place. These procedures should outline who can authorize access, the reasons for visits, and approval levels for different visitors. They should also specify whether visitors can be unescorted and who may act as escorts.
A log of visitor access should be maintained, either manually or electronically. All individuals inside the facility must wear visible identification badges, with visitors' badges easily distinguishable from employees’. If a visitor requires an escort, their badge should indicate this.
CCTV cameras may be used for additional monitoring, but visitors should be informed of their presence. Camera footage can be reviewed if suspicious activity occurs.

## Physical Security Personnel
### Security Personnel
Nothing can substitute the judgment of a human and that's why we use guards. In places where we want to make a bold statement about security we use uniformed guard that may or may not be also armed.
### Security Protocols
- ***Two-­person integrity*** : helps add a layer of security if one person is compromised needing to collude with another person.
- ***Two-­person control*** : Have two people do sensitive functions like in a nuclear submarine where two people need to engage a key at the same time.

> [!note] Exam Tip
> It’s very easy to confuse two-­person integrity and two-­person control. Remember that two-­person integrity is about access to sensitive physical facilities, whereas two-person control is about performing sensitive actions.

# Exam Essentials
- Cybersecurity professionals should put controls in place that limit access to sensitive facilities, including data centers, server rooms, media storage facilities, evidence storage rooms, wiring closets, and cable distribution runs.
- The three goals of crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) are natural surveillance, natural access control, and natural territorial reinforcement.
- Visitor access to sensitive facilities should be carefully controlled with procedures that describe who can authorize visitor access and how visitors can behave in your facilities. Visitor access should be recorded in a log, and visitors should wear badges that clearly identify their status.
- Two-­person integrity requires that two people be present for any access to a sensitive area, such as where valuable items are stored. Two-­person control is used to control access to very sensitive functions, requiring the concurrence of two individuals to carry out an action.
